# Complexity Analysis

## main.js:

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is linear in the worst case, primarily determined by the `while` loop in `simulateRiceCooker`.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is constant. The memory used is independent of the input size.

## mainRefactoring.js:

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is also linear in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is constant.
